Understanding a customer's
feelings, needs, and feedback is crucial for any business, including BA..<br>

**Background** In the Context of a British Airways Data Science job simulation taken on Forage, My Task was to scrape, collect customer feedback, review data from a third-party source, and analyse 
this data to present any insights I may uncover.After that, Build a predictive model to understand factors that influence buying behaviour. <br>

**Objective**: Scrape and analyse customer review data to uncover findings for British Airways;Build a predictive model to understand factors that influence buying behaviour <br>
**Methods Used**: Data Scraping, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization, NLP, Machine Learning, Predictive Modeling.<br>
**Type of Problem**: Binary Classification Task. <br>
**Language, Libraries, technologies used**: Python, Pandas,WordCloud, TextBlob, NRCLex,,Nltk, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, Scipy, Scikit-learn<br>

## KEY INSIGHTS: 
- Our analysis revealed that 15% of the customers completed their booking, which means that Noncomplete rate is relatively high compared to the completion rate
- Our Model performs very well on unseen data with an accuracy of 0.95, a precision of 0.92, a recall of 0.99, and a f1 score of 0,95. A recall of 0,99 means that our model was able to identify 99% of the time, actual bookings that were completed
- purchase lead, flight hour, and length of stay are the three largest drivers that help the model predict.
